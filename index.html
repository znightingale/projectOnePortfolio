            <div id="columnContainer">
                <p class="paragraph"> I am a student, designer, nature-lover, barista, content creator, and aspiring musician from Northern California. <br> <br>
                    My current interests cover are wide range of activities from producing indie pop music, streaming and posting
                    YouTube videos about Super Smash Bros Melee, learning new recipes to cook, and
                    enjoying my part-time job at a local coffee shop. These things all give me joy and satisfaction in their own way and provide a different outlet for my creative energy. When I'm not at school or doing homework, I am always doing one of these things and tend to be very busy because of that. 
                    Even so, I try to convince myself that it's okay to take it slow and enjoy little things along the way. I work best and enjoy things best when I am well rested and relaxed, so that is how I try to be all the time. <br> <br> 
                    I attend San Fransisco State University, and am hoping to find a career that lets me be creative and genuinly happy while also being able
                    to get by. That has led me to studying Visual Communication Design, where I get to study the things that are the most interesting to me and also assist me in my favorite extracurricular activities. Aside from my regular workload,
                    I currently am working on a research project about the history of the department of design at the school. I've been lucky enough to interview some incredible retired professors
                    and get fascinating insights on the topic. That has gotten me into design history a lot more, and it's becoming one of my favorite things to study right now. 
                    Between my many hobbies, classes, part-time job, and research project, I know I have a lot going on, but I'm excited to see
                    where the field will take me and what the next big part of my life will be! </p>
