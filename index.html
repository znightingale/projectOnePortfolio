            <div id="columnContainer">
                <p class="paragraph"> I am a student, designer, and aspiring creative from Northern California! My current interests
                    cover are wide range of activities from producing indie pop music, streaming and posting
                    YouTube videos about Super Smash Bros Melee, learning new recipes to cook, and
                    enjoying my part-time job as a barista at a local coffee shop. Sometimes I struggle to
                    find enough time to endulge in all of my favorite parts of life, but I have to remember
                    that as long as I am doing what makes me happy, it's okay to take it slow. In school I am
                    hoping to find a career that lets me be creative and genuinly happy while also being able
                    to get by. That has led me to the Design program, where I am becoming especially interested
                    in design history and user experience. I know I have a lot going on, but I'm excited to see
                    where the field will take me and what the next big part of my life will be! </p>
