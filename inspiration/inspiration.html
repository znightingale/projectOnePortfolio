            <p class="inspoParagraph"> David M Bird is an ex-lego product designer that now uses acorns, twigs, leaves, and other natural materials to create what he calls “Becorns.” His work is absolutely adorable and helps me want to connect with nature more at every opportunity. I admire that he found a way to pursue his passion in a new, more sustainable way.</p>

            </div>
                <p class="inspoParagraph"> Amanita Design is an indie game developer that makes breathtaking environments in their point-and-click puzzle games. Their games have stunning soundtracks too, and are inspiring to me as <em> Gesamtkunstwerks,</em> or cohesive works of art, and it remind me that simple processes can be really meaningful if you pay attention to the details and take your time.</p>

            </div>
                <p class="inspoParagraph"> Hiatus Kaiyote is an alternative band from Australia that have a super unique feel. They create complicated rhythmic patterns and chord progressions while somehow maintaining a laid-back vibe that isn't overwhelming. Nai Palm, the lead singer of Hiatus Kaiyote, is the backbone of the whole band and has such a unique singing style that brings every idea together perfectly.</p>
