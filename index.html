<p> I am a student, designer, and aspiring creative from Northern California! My current interests <br>
    cover are wide range of activities from producing indie pop music, streaming and posting <br>
    YouTube videos about Super Smash Bros Melee, learning new recipes to cook, and <br>
    enjoying my part-time job as a barista at a local coffee shop. Sometimes I struggle to <br>
    find enough time to endulge in all of my favorite parts of life, but I have to remember <br>
    that as long as I am doing what makes me happy, it's okay to take it slow. In school I am <br>
    hoping to find a career that lets me be creative and genuinly happy while also being able <br>
    to get by. That has led me to the Design program, where I am becoming especially interested <br>
    in design history and user experience. I know I have a lot going on, but I'm excited to see <br>
    where the field will take me and what the next big part of my life will be! </p>
